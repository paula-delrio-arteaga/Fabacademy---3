<h1>Portable Photobioreactor</h1>
<h2>FabAcademy Microchallenge 3</h2>

<p>Design and make an **ethical tool or artifact** that allows you to interact with others</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
  <p>This new and improved project is a second iteration of our photobioreator from microchallenge 2. This photobioreactor is a space for spirulina to thrive and grow in a controlled environment for cultivation.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Though the previous photobioreactor worked well for demonstrative purposes and was more fun-looking in a visual way, we wanted to create one that was more functional. This PBR will be easier to transport, move around to different locations, and is more compact. It also includes a bottom component where a harvesting bottle can be stored.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The PBR maintains optimal conditions for spirulina by providing and monitoring the correct amount of light, temperature, and airflow. By using a light sensor, we are able to determine the density of the spirulina and its growth by the amount of light passage. The temperature sensor will tell us if the spirulina water is getting too cool. The pumps provide airflow by means of air bubbles and circulation. The removable caps allow the user to easily remove the top and tubes by taking it off to harvest. The data from the sensors will be sent to computers via wifi to be monitored.</p>

<h3>Plan And Execution</h3>
  <p>Before starting anything, we began by thinking back on the photobioreator1.0 and establishing what we wanted to change, modify, or keep the same. We then researched and looked for inspiration through other spirulina growing references we found. Some of these resources included Eduardo Chamorroâ€™s project Sphira and a company for growing your own spirulina called spirulina society. We threw all of our ideas onto the miro board, wrote down a rough plan of what we would do each day of the week, and got started. Given the need for practicality and more complex electronics, we decided to make the design relatively simple compared to the previous one.</p>

<h3>Fabrication Process and Materials</h3>

  <h4>Electronics</h4>
  <p>We first designed the stand/box in rhino. The upper panels of acrylic and mdf were cut on the laser cutter while the drawer and structure of the box was cut using the CNC. The bottle caps were modeled and then 3D printed with flexible filament. After everything was cut, the pieces were assembled into a box. To create the sensor mold, it was first 3D printed, then hard silicone was poured in while the sensors were suspended. LED lights were inserted into the top panel to provide light to the bottles from below.</p>


  <h4>Fabrication</h4>
    <p>- 3mm Acrylic pane 2mm mdf sheet
- 2 large glass bottles
- 1 small glass harvesting bottle
- 12mm wood sheet
- Tubing
- Grow LED lights
- Tube connectors
- Screws</p>

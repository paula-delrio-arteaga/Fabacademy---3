<h1>Portable Photobioreactor</h1>
<h2>FabAcademy Microchallenge 3</h2>

<p>Design and make an **ethical tool or artifact** that allows you to interact with others</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
  <p>This new and improved project is a second iteration of our photobioreator from microchallenge 2. This photobioreactor is a space for spirulina to thrive and grow in a controlled environment for cultivation.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Though the previous photobioreactor worked well for demonstrative purposes and was more fun-looking in a visual way, we wanted to create one that was more functional. This PBR will be easier to transport, move around to different locations, and is more compact. It also includes a bottom component where a harvesting bottle can be stored.</p>
